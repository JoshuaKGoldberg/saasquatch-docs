<h3>How does Referral SaaSquatch know that a referral has been made?</h3>
<p>Referral SaaSquatch uses integration with your subscription management system, link tracking, cookie tracking and JavaScript widgets to track from first interaction right to payment. Since we get notified when actual dollars are transfered, you'll only end up giving discounts for real quantifiable new revenue.</p>

<h3>Do my customers have to signup with Referral SaaSquatch before they can make a referral?</h3>
<p><strong>No, your customers don't need a Referral SaaSquatch account</strong>. By installing Referral SaaSquatch in your app all of your customers will automatically be enrolled. We do this to make inviting friends as fast and seamless as possible, to both increase participation in the program and to protect your brand.</p>

<h3>Can customers complete a referral over the phone?</h3>
<p>Yes. You will simply add the coupon code they were given to their account manual through your subscription provider. Once that user then logs into your system the referral will be completed.</p>

<h3>What happens when a user clicks on a sharelink?</h3>
<p>The sharelink sends the user to our servers, on which we place a cookie with their referral code, before forwarding them to your landing page. <strong>We store this cookie for 365 days.<strong> This means that if a user follows the sharelink, but not signs up immediately, we can still track the referral later. Please bear in mind that if the user clears their cache or switches to a different browser, we might not be able to track the referral.</p>
