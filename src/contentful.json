To implement a referral program you need to develop a strategy for how and when a user will be identified to SaaSquatch. Typically this happens whenever a user logs in to your website or service, or makes a purchase. When you \"Identify\" a user, you enroll them to be able to refer their friends and to track if they have been referred. For details on how referrals are tracked see [Attribution](/topics/attribution/) and [Conversion](/topics/conversion/)."

This usually involves a company providing information about the active user to Referral SaaSquatch using our REST API or Squatch.js, our javascript library. Here are a few examples of common ways that people identify users.\n\n - **eCommerce:** After someone completes a purchase, they visit a \"Thank You\" page. On this page, an ecommerce company loads Squatch.js to track the email address, user id and name of the person that just made a purchase. This identifying information is used to build a contact record in SaaSquatch so that this person that just purchased can make referrals, or if they were referred, so they can be [attributed as a referral](/topics/attribution) and [marked as converted](/topics/conversion).\n - **SaaS:** Identification usually happens by including Squatch.js on every page of your web application. After launching your referral program, then the first time someone signs into your product, they'll have their email address, user id and name synched with SaaSquatch. If someone has been referred, then this identifying information will be used to [attribute](/topics/attribution) any referrals that happened.\n - **Mobile:** Identification usually happens when someone signs up for a user account. When someone is created in the server database, it is also created as a record in the SaaSquatch database using the SaaSquatch REST API.\n\n\n### Accounts vs Users\n\nReferral SaaSquatch supports referral tracking for both B2B and B2C workflows by seperating an \"Account\" and a \"User\".\nUsers are for people. Accounts are for companies or groups. Users have individual contact records for a person with names, email addresses, profile pictures and share links. Accounts have \none or more users in them and have rewards and reward balances. For more information, read the article on [Shared vs Solo Accounts](/shared-vs-solo-accounts/).\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>\n    <strong>Shared</strong> Account\n</th>\n<td>\n    <i class=\"fa fa-users\"></i> Multiple users share the same billing information. [Read More](/shared-vs-solo-accounts/)\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>\n    <strong>Solo</strong> Account\n</th>\n<td>\n    <i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i> Every user has their own billing information.

This is a short list to get your familiar with some of the terms and referral lingo. \n\n- __Referrer__\n\n  A person who invites another person to try the product or service.\n\n- __Referred User / Referree__\n\n  A person who was referred by another person.\n\n- __[Touchpoints](/success/touchpoints/)__\n\n  The components of your referral program that your users interact with to participate in or get information about the referral program.\n\n- __Referral Widget__\n\n  The main window that enables your users to share the referral program with their friends and track their individual progress. \n\n- __Share messages__\n\n  Predefined social or messaging copy that explain the offer and have a clear CTA. Used by your customers to invite friends and family. \n\n- __Notification emails__\n\n  Emails the referrer receives to notify them about their referral progress. \n\n- __Rewards__\n\n  The reward you are handing out to your users for making a successful referral. I.E. 10% discount on their next bill,  $25 store credit, loyalty points, or a t-shirt. \n\n- __[Conversion](/success/core-topics/#Conversion)__\n\n  The last step a referred user needs to complete in order for the referral to be considered successful and generate a reward for the referrer. This can vary from account sign up, lead submission, paid subscription started, to a checkout depending on the business. \n\nOur [Core Topics](/success/core-topics/) article provides more in depth information on these topics. \n\n### Components of a referral program\nThe referral program is build up from a range of different components that interact with both your existing and newly brought on users. Components like the referral widget or the reward fulfillment tie into your website and payment system. Let’s start with the main interface your customers will interact with.\n\n#### Referral Widget\nThe Referral Widget is easily loaded by providing SaaSquatch with a few details about your customers. SaaSquatch will return a fully rendered responsive referral widget that you can load inside your product or service. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/1lORITdPfyMQWkqY2gosE4/1117d2d91ab9d230300828318f25e8e4/referral_widget_live.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![referral widget live](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/1lORITdPfyMQWkqY2gosE4/1117d2d91ab9d230300828318f25e8e4/referral_widget_live.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThis touchpoint engages your current customers and explains the offer. Make sure to stay on point and communicate clearly with your users how the referral program works, and what they need to do to earn their reward. The referral widget’s CTA is for your users to start sharing with their friends. \n\nMore information about the referral widget, and how users interact with your referral program can be found in our [touchpoints](/success/touchpoints/) article.\n\n#### Sharing Options \nInside the Referral Widget your users can share the referral offer on a variety of channels. By default E-mail, Twitter and Facebook share buttons are visible to your users. You can work together with your Customer Success team to add or remove share options and pick the best options that match your customer base. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4Oed6VvJ9egQcaGESi6o88/262315336d01d54968fb3f7964da0599/facebook_share_messaging_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![facebook share messaging options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4Oed6VvJ9egQcaGESi6o88/262315336d01d54968fb3f7964da0599/facebook_share_messaging_options.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div> <a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4oRHdLbUakEoQuOkgMy06O/3fcae2a2f6d6c873e89818ca7a3c23a7/twitter_share_messaging_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">![twitter share messaging options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4oRHdLbUakEoQuOkgMy06O/3fcae2a2f6d6c873e89818ca7a3c23a7/twitter_share_messaging_options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nMore info and examples are available in the [Share Options](success/share-options/) article. \n\n#### Unique Sharelink & referral codes\nOne of the main goals of the sharing messages is to have a referrer share their unique sharelink and / or referral code to their friends, the potential referred customers. These are the primary ways of establishing referral connections between two users, a process we call [Attribution](/success/core-topics/#Attribution). \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3YnsN3TmMM0KwEUySKMC28/5350d208f41b8ec9504ab21d3d9d2adb/referral_widget_link_code.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![referral widget link code](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3YnsN3TmMM0KwEUySKMC28/5350d208f41b8ec9504ab21d3d9d2adb/referral_widget_link_code.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThe Unique Sharelink performs two tasks when it is clicked by a referred visitor.  First it drops a tracking cookie in the user’s browser, this allows us to know who sent this potential customer, and automatically create a referral connection. Secondly it redirects this new traffic to your website. You can decide whether you want to funnel them through your normal sign up or purchase flow, or set up a designated Landing page. \n\nReferral Codes are a way to establish a referral connection without tracking cookies. The referred user receives the code from their friend and is required to fill in the referral code on a form during checkout or registration. Alternatively, this can be autofilled as a coupon or into  another relevant field.  More info on Unique Sharelinks & Referral Codes can be found in our [Share Options](/success/share-options/#Code) article. \n\n#### Landing page \nThis is the first impression of your product that potential new customers will see, so make it count! A designated Landing page is a great place to recognize that the user was referred, explain the offer they will receive and why they should sign up. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5BGt1hHuYoK4qykU0Kwaiy/43e952b9fd591cc607b21e0b3b372aba/referral_landing_page_example.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![referral landing page example](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5BGt1hHuYoK4qykU0Kwaiy/43e952b9fd591cc607b21e0b3b372aba/referral_landing_page_example.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n#### Sign up flow\nIf you offer some sort of discount or credit to the referred user, you should enhance your sign up flow to reflect this change. Whether you flag the newly created account for a pending account credit, add a generic discount code to their order, or give them additional free time, the reward fulfillment comes into play.  \n\nOnce the referred user signed up for your service of product, you can identify them to SaaSquatch through the Referral Widget and entice them to start making their own referrals. \n\n#### Billing & Reward fulfillment \nDepending on the reward that you have chosen for your referral program, the reward fulfillment can range from your customers automatically receiving a gift card through email, their next bill being lowered automatically through our Payment Provider integrations, or them receiving an account credit for a future purchase. \n\nReferral SaaSquatch can [help you choose the right reward](http://www.referralsaasquatch.com/choosing-rewards-for-your-referral-program/) for your Referral Program and provide you with all the caveats and details on the reward fulfillment steps.\n#### Notification emails\nWhenever a referred user signs up for your service, Referral SaaSquatch can automatically send the referrer an update on the progress of their referral. This email is a great way to give positive feedback to your users and inform them of any earned rewards. We also include the sharing options from the Referral Widget in these emails so the user can easily refer more friends. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3kY9y28NlSuGeMWMUCG8yu/0f6bf73f89147f629986a4502f521ba3/parkwhiz_referral_complete_email.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![parkwhiz referral complete email](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3kY9y28NlSuGeMWMUCG8yu/0f6bf73f89147f629986a4502f521ba3/parkwhiz_referral_complete_email.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nMore information on the referral program email notifications is available in our [Touchpoints](/success/touchpoints/) article or in our [technical documentation](/topics/email/). \n\n### Managing a referral program\nSo you have a referral program that’s up and running, great! Now let’s go over what you should keep an eye on. \n\n#### Take a look at your analytics\nThe SaaSquatch portal’s [Analytics](/features/analytics/) page gives you vital information about your Referral Program’s performance. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4VtCAG8wA0M8IiQuSqgkQI/e917640076cc8f95d49d8308d3dfe429/analtytics_preview.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![analtytics preview](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4VtCAG8wA0M8IiQuSqgkQI/e917640076cc8f95d49d8308d3dfe429/analtytics_preview.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n#### Key Analytics metrics to look at:\nReferred Visitors: The number of time your referral program sharelinks have been clicked.\nReferred Users: The number of users who have signed up for your service as a result of a referral\nPaid Conversions: The number of new paying customers successfully referred to your service.\nMore information on what analytics metrics are available, definitions of each of the terms, and how to make the most of the analytics portal can be found in our [analytics docs](/features/analytics/).\n\n#### Take a look at potential fraud cases \nThe SaaSquatch Portal comes with a security system that helps you keep the bad apples out and reward real referrals. More info on our [Security features is available in our documentation](/fraud-and-security/). \n### Referral Program best practices \nWhether you launched your Referral Program months ago or are looking to kick off soon, these best practices and tips will help you get the best results. \n\n#### Make sure the program is visible \nWith the Referral SaaSquatch platform you can surface the Referral Widget on different places inside your product which helps drive more engagement from your users. For example you can surface the program after your customer makes a purchase, fills out a feedback form or upgrades to a bigger plan. \n\nYou can also incorporate the program information, or even the user’s unique sharelinks in transactional emails and other touch points inside your product. \n#### Pick a reward that your customers actually want\nThe core part of your Referral Program is the reward you hand out to your users. Pick a double sided reward that both sides would love to get. \n\nIf you are running a B2B product or service where your users don’t pay the invoice themselves, consider a Gift Card program. Instead of getting a discount the user doesn’t feel or experience themselves, give them the opportunity to buy that new gadget or book to get a positive brand experience and keep the referrals flowing. \n#### Hand out rewards as soon as possible\nWe all like to get our reward as soon as we earned it. Although from a business perspective it might make sense to hold off on rewarding the referrer until the referred user pays their second invoice, the long delay in reward fulfillment may cause less participation in your program. The more strongly, and quickly, and action is rewarded the more likely it is to be repeated. \n#### Keep things simple\nHaving a hard time explaining the offer to your customers? Try keeping the offer simple so it’s easy to communicate to your customers. The rule of thumb is; If you can’t explain the offer to your customers in a single sentence, then simplify the offer.\n\nLooking for more ways to optimize your referral program? \nDownload our [E-Commerce Referral Marketing Guide](http://get.referralsaasquatch.com/ecommerce-referral-marketing-ebook-resources/)\n### Further resources & reading material\nNow that you have a healthy referral program acquiring new customers for you, here are some additional resources to help you get the most out of your referral marketing strategy.\n- [SaaS Case Study with Typeform](http://get.referralsaasquatch.com/case-study-typeform-website/)\n- [Referral Marketing Best Practices Guide](http://get.referralsaasquatch.com/resources-referral-program-best-practice/)\n- [Referral Program User Experience Guide](http://get.referralsaasquatch.com/resources-user-experience-ebook/)\n"

            },
            "content": {
                "en-US": "Some examples of fraud are:\n\n - **Self-referral**: existing users creating fake referrals to take advantage of referral prizes\n - **Exploitation**: anonymous internet users creating referrals for personal financial gain\n - **Account Cycling**: existing users signing up for and cancelling subsequent accounts\n - **Broadcasting**: Posting referral links on coupon sites or other locations your company does not approve of\n\nThere are three parts to a complete fraud management strategy:\n\n - **Prevention**: the best strategy for fraud management is in the structure of your referral program and identity systems to make fraud financially and logically infeasible.\n - **Detection**: in some cases not all types of fraud can be prevented, leaving additional cases to be detected through automated algorithms and human oversight.\n - **Response**: every business has their own practices on how best to respond to fraud cases, like removing rewards, suspending accounts or even seeking legal recompense.\n\n\n### Fraud Prevention\n\nThe best strategy for fraud management is to prevent fraud before it happens. This can usually be accomplished by choosing the right structure for the referral incentives and the goalpost required to earn a referral credit:\n\n - **Conversion goalposts should be meaningful** to customer acquisition. Typical examples include making a purchase or fully experiencing a product such as setting up a website, verifying a phone number or making your first post. This makes exploiting the referral program harder, while still achieving your business goals.\n - **Incentives should be profitable** to the company immediately or shortly after the conversion goal post is passed by the referred user. This reduces the financial risk of any potential fraud, and in some cases can ensure a positive ROI from every possible referral.\n\nReferral SaaSquatch fraud prevention also takes advantage of a company's existing account and identity systems and leverages them to simplify referral program integration and the fraud preventions systems involved.\n\nReferral SaaSquatch comes with several built-in fraud prevention features:\n\n - **Existing User Detection**: Referral SaaSquatch blocks current paying customers from being referred. This protects against paying users referring themselves or paying users finding a referral link in the wild (i.e. social media or coupon sites) and using it to get a false discount. \n\n - **Two-step Referral Tracking**: Referral SaaSquatch tracks a referral for new users is separated into the two steps of Attribution and Conversion. This lets your referral program be structured so that referral rewards are only triggered for *conversion* goalpost events like purchases even though referrals are fully tracked for free accounts, un-verified accounts or partial carts. \n\n - **Consolidated identity**: Referral SaaSquatch is designed to easily connect with your user database and other identity systems. Users in SaaSquatch are tracked by account and user identities, which means that your existing systems for account de-duplication, email address verification, credit card authorization, social log-in, and account lockdown are automatically tied into your referral program.\n\n - **Explicit Double-sided Incentive Management**: Referral SaaSquatch manages all rewards associated with a referral program; both the rewards earned from making referrals as well as the rewards given to new users in a double-sided incentive program. Referral SaaSquatch also ties these rewards tightly to your users identities. This lets companies have complete control over what rewards users have access to, revoke rewards, track payout and avoid the potential headaches of leaked global-use coupon codes or secret landing pages.\n\nOther fraud prevention measures that involve other systems:\n\n- **The Threat of Cancellation**: Existing users that are looking to game the referral system can often be deterred by the threat of losing access to their account. This is particularly effective for SaaS, games, or marketplace companies because users often have vested value in keeping their accounts active, and fear losing access to a service they regularly use. \n\n\n**Example 1: Bad Incentive, Shallow Goalpost, No Implicit Prevention**: For example, imagine a referral program that gives people $100 in cash for each email address that they provide to an anonymous web form. It is easy to exploit this type program by providing fake email addresses, and anonymous users making referrals. While it would still be possible to create systems for fraud detection and response within Referral SaaSquatch, it would be a routine exercise to get around those systems with access to fake email addresses and proxy servers. Even if someone was caught repeatedly abusing the system, they would have already received their cash payout and the company would have no viable tracking means to pursue response from potentially anonymous individuals.\n\n**Example 2: Good Incentive, Rewards for payment, Implicit Prevention Constraints**: The referral program structure gives people a credit towards a future purchase when a friend makes a purchase. The credit can only be applied against future purchases, preventing people from exploiting the system for cash benefit. The credit is associated with an account, so if someone is caught, the credit could be revoked, the account canceled. The friends are required to make a purchase, creating a paper trail of purchase information (such as credit card) that can be used to de-duplicate accounts, and for fraud detection and response.\n\n\n### Fraud Detection\n\nThe best strategy for fraud management is preventing fraud before it happens, but a company may not have natural systems to prevent fraud, like verifying emails or de-duplicating accounts. In these cases, Referral SaaSquatch provides a way to detect and address fraud.\n\n**Example of detection**: A company's account system does not prevent an email address from being used for more than one account, creating a potential fraud hole since people could refer themselves using their own email address. Referral SaaSquatch helps fill that hole by detecting when two users with the same email address sign up.\n\n**Referral Moderation**\n\nReferral SaaSquatch provides a referral moderation functionality that works much like a blog comment moderation system. You may elect to:\n\n - Approve all referrals until revoked\n - Pend all referrals until approved\n - Approve one side of a referral and pend the other (i.e. approve newly referred users’ prizes while pending referrer’s prizes)\n\nIf you elect to use the referral moderation functionality you will be notified every 24 hours of all referrals requiring review. \n\n### Fraud Response\n\nThe best strategy for fraud management is preventing fraud before it happens, but sometimes you may need to respond to fraud cases regardless either on a one-off basis, or as a general strategy.\n\n**Investigation**\n\nThe first step of responding to a potential fraud case is investigation. Not all cases are worth a formal action. In some cases, for example, multiple people may genuinely share the same name, and the potential case can be ignored.\n\nIn the Referral SaaSquatch security view you can easily see all approved and pending referrals. Each referral shows you dates of the referral and the names of the referrer and referred users. If you see similar names all in a short period, then it’s likely that you have a case of self-referral fraud.\n\nIf the names do not match but you are still suspicious of a referral, perhaps one user has made a large number of referrals in rapid succession, you are able to investigate the referral further and review:\n\n- The IP address of the referrer and referred user\n- The email address of the referrer and referred user\n- The site the referred user clicked the referral link from\n\nAlternatively, if you are suspicious of a specific user you can view their referral history from their profile, which will show you the name and email address of each person they referred. You can then further investigate each referral to verify IP address and referring site. \n\n**Action**\n\nReferral SaaSquatch lets you both **moderate referrals** as they come in, as well as **revoke historical credit** that has not yet been used.\n\n - **Referral Moderation**: Referral SaaSquatch has the ability to mark referral rewards as `PENDING` while one of your agents performs a review. The agent can choose to either Approve or Deny the referral. When a referral is denied, rewards for both sides are either cancelled or never created. If a referral is approved during moderation, it can later be denied. Any rewards that have not been consumed will be cancelled.\n\n - **Cancel Historical Credit**: Referral SaaSquatch allows referral credits to be revoked at any time, regardless of whether they were auto-approved, manually approved, or denied. Any referral can be approved or denied as many times as needed for your business case. There is no timeline by when rewards can be cancelled, but some reward types by their very nature are uncancellable, like for example a coupon that has already been redeemed.\n\nFraud response strategies may also involve other external systems, like your account, ecommerce or CRM systems. Other types of fraud action may not explicitly rely on using Referral SaaSquatch.\n\n - **Account Cancellation**: If someone has been found to be repeatedly abusing the referral system, a logical avenue of recourse would be to cancel their account and blacklist them. In most cases the threat of this is sufficient to stop the activity in question.\n\n\n### Fraud Services\n\nFraud management is not one size fits all. Referral SaaSquatch provides a number of professional services to help design, manage and maintain your referral program and the fraud, gaming and fake referral considerations therein.\n\n - **Fraud Management Strategy Consultation Services**: Referral SaaSquatch has implemented fraud management solutions across industries such eCommerce, SaaS, mobile and POS situations for private and publicly traded companies, startups and fortune 500 companies alike. Companies that subscribe to our Pro and Enterprise plans are eligible for limited complimentary consultation as part of the onboarding package. Further consultations are available on a per hour or per diem basis.\n\n - **Fraud Investigation Services**: Referral SaaSquatch investigates all reported patterns of fraud as a service to our customers. We continuously monitor for new types of fraud, gaming and fake referrals to stay on top of the new development in social network sharing, privacy blocking systems, proxy networks and anonymous systems.

RS for Salesforce automatically loads user records into Salesforce as a separate custom object called __SaaSquatch User__. These records are then linked to a Lead or Contact when the email address matches. Leads and Contacts automatically have their custom fields and related lists updated based upon the matched record.\n\n### How are duplicates handled?\n\n - __Duplicate Contact or Leads in Salesforce__ - RS for Salesforce links the first record with the right email address.\n - __Leads that a duplicates Contact__ - RS for Salesforce links to Contacts first and Leads second.\n - __Merging duplicates__ - RS for Salesforce will map to the merged record only if it has the right email address.\n - __Updating Email__ - RS for Salesforce will immediately relink a record when an email address changed.\n\n### Why isn't a user syncing to Salesforce?\n\nHere are some reasons a Lead or Contact is not getting linked:\n\n- A __Validation Rule__ on your Lead or Contact record is prevent RS for Salesforce from updating records.\n- A __SaaSquatch User__ has been created, but the email address in SaaSquatch doesn't exactly match the email of the Lead or Contact.\n\n### Does it work with Salesforce Lightning Experience?\n\nYes, Referral SaaSquatch for Salesforce will work out of the box with both Salesforce Classic and Salesforce Lightning Experience.\n\n### Which Salesforce Editions do you support?\n\nOur integration uses the Salesforce Bulk API for efficient loading and synchronization of large data sets, so we only support Professional, Enterprise, Performance and Unlimited Editions.\n\n### What other features should I know about?\n\nHere are some important features to know about:\n - Supports synchronization of historical data. Turn it on or off at any point.\n - Use custom fields to simplify integration into your Marketing Automation systems like Marketo, Hubspot and Pardot.\n - Works with __custom salesforce reports__, __process builder__, __workflow rules__ and the other Salesforce tools you're used to using.\n - Support conversion tracking customization. Conversions can be triggered on Opportunity Won, based off custom Process Builder actions, based on any arbitrary APEX event or Trigger, or external conversion events using the SaaSquatch REST API\n - Self-healing linking will automatically heal the link between SaaSquatch and Salesforce if a Lead or Contact is Merged, Converted or Deleted\n - Attribution tracking persists into Opportunities when a Lead is converted\n - Works with both Inbound Referral and Outbound Referral workflows\n"

                "en-US": "The touchpoints are all the components of your referral program that your users will interact with. These include the desktop and mobile widget, notification emails, share messages, and marketing emails. \n\nFor a referral program to be successful it is crucial that each of these components is providing a unified, clear, and concise message about how the referral program works; the user’s progress within it; and what the user needs to do next. When users are well-informed about the availability of a referral program, what the program offers, and how to get involved, it makes it easier for them to start making successful referrals. \n\nThe sections below discuss the touchpoint components of a referral program, the role they each play, and how your users will be interacting with them.\n### Widgets\nThe Referral Saasquatch platform provides a responsive widget for users to access. The widget is a one-stop-shop for your users to participate in the referral program; they can refer friends, track the status of their referrals, and see the rewards earned from referrals.This can be surfaced anywhere users can be identified on your website and used to track users for registration, display the widget, and more. \n#### Desktop Widget\nThe responsive desktop widget provides full support for the Referral SaaSquatch themes which allow you to customize your referral program to pixel-perfect brand constraints. The desktop widget can either be served as a popup / modal window, or embedded directly into the page. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/1lORITdPfyMQWkqY2gosE4/1117d2d91ab9d230300828318f25e8e4/referral_widget_live.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![referral widget live](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/1lORITdPfyMQWkqY2gosE4/1117d2d91ab9d230300828318f25e8e4/referral_widget_live.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nDetails about [theming](/themes/) your widget and complete install [guides](/guides/) for integrating our referral widget into your website or mobile app, are available in the documentation.\n#### Mobile Widget\nReferral SaaSquatch provides a fully responsive mobile widget that can be embedded directly into your iOS, Android, or Windows phone mobile apps.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3dnC1OlCBOMAcAG884q2uc/714245d74b13b856c22da9a5b289a323/referral_widget_live_mobile.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![referral widget live mobile](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3dnC1OlCBOMAcAG884q2uc/714245d74b13b856c22da9a5b289a323/referral_widget_live_mobile.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nIncluding the referral widget into your mobile app can be as simple as including a user’s personalized URL in a WebView or iFrame component. This will load a mobile-responsive web page as part of your app, look after the referral tracking, and let your users refer their friends.\n\nFor complete control over the look and experience of your referral program in your app we provide a comprehensive [Mobile SDK](/mobile/). The Mobile SDK, available on our enterprise plans, allows you to build your referral programs natively into your mobile applications on iOS and Android.\nDetails about including the widget in your mobile app, configuring the mobile widget theme, the Mobile SDK, and examples of implementations on iOS and Android are available in the [documentation](/mobile/).\n### Share Messages\nReferral SaaSquatch widget and email themes include [sharing options](/success/share-options/) that allow your users to share their referral link on Facebook, Twitter, or by email with ease. The Referral SaaSquatch social media integration helps reducing the friction for users looking to share their referral link by not requiring users to authorize access to their Facebook or Twitter account in order to share their post.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5xZa7pLe5qcE60G6WKaUgW/97872e44b893f0e7e5b5fc0f1a9ed6ae/tile_facebook_share_message_example.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\"> ![tile facebook share message example](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5xZa7pLe5qcE60G6WKaUgW/97872e44b893f0e7e5b5fc0f1a9ed6ae/tile_facebook_share_message_example.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div> <a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5IZKIyX2jCo42Uq4wc8UsW/c62dd4726c2e9199e6a0354c4f295ac2/tile_twitter_share_message_example.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\"> ![tile twitter share message example](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/5IZKIyX2jCo42Uq4wc8UsW/c62dd4726c2e9199e6a0354c4f295ac2/tile_twitter_share_message_example.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\" ></i> Preview</div> <a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/7iCU1mPbfGaKGq6MYsWgkQ/b8fb509cbb057542fcc67df7f664b098/email_share.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\"> ![email share](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/7iCU1mPbfGaKGq6MYsWgkQ/b8fb509cbb057542fcc67df7f664b098/email_share.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nWithin the Referral SaaSquatch portal, you can provide pre-written messaging for all social sharing options to ensure that essentials like the user’s unique sharelink are included correctly, and that the messaging is captivating and relevant. User’s can still edit the posts, but providing a solid starting point can help improve program performance.  You can also update the messaging any time, to maintain consistency with other promotions or seasonal offerings. \n\n### Notification Emails\nReferral SaaSquatch provides a complete notification email service for your referral program. \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3kY9y28NlSuGeMWMUCG8yu/0f6bf73f89147f629986a4502f521ba3/parkwhiz_referral_complete_email.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![parkwhiz referral complete email](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3kY9y28NlSuGeMWMUCG8yu/0f6bf73f89147f629986a4502f521ba3/parkwhiz_referral_complete_email.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nEmail notifications are available to be sent whenever a referred user signs up for a new trial or free account, and then again whenever a referral is converted. These notifications allow the referrer to keep track of the progress of their referrals and be notified when they have earned their reward. By default, the notification emails also include referral program sharing options, to further incentivize participation. \n\nPro and Enterprise accounts are able to utilize the theme engine to fully customize the email HTML and CSS, to perfectly match your transactional or marketing email templates and branding. \n### Marketing Emails\nMarketing, blast, or mass emails are a great way to promote your referral program to your existing user base or email subscription list. Pro and Enterprise customers can make use of the Referral SaaSquatch mass user import functionality. By providing a list of existing users, Referral SaaSquatch will register them and return an export with their unique share links. This data can be imported into an email platform, like Mailchimp, where the share links can be utilized as merge variables. Individual share links can also be looked up using an [API call](/api/methods/#get_sharelinks) for use in personalized emails. These powerful tools make it possible to deliver emails with all the information user’s need to participate in your referral program directly from their inbox!\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThese touchpoints tie in closely with the structure of a referral program that is covered in our [Core topics](/success/core-topics/) article. \n\nTo learn more about referral programs and how to get your program up and running, check out our [Referral Program 101](/success/intro/) article."

These cover the complete referral process from beginning (user discovery) to end (fulfilling rewards). \n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4n6LXqOHAcYG6KIEAUY8EI/d20f566ee0cd6e87adb61b412355de17/Pasted_image_at_2016_07_29_11_11_AM.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![Pasted image at 2016 07 29 11 11 AM](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4n6LXqOHAcYG6KIEAUY8EI/d20f566ee0cd6e87adb61b412355de17/Pasted_image_at_2016_07_29_11_11_AM.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\n### Engagement\nThe engagement component of the referral process is all about figuring out how to best interact with existing customers. In order to direct a user's attention towards your referral program you should take advantage of channels that they interact with everyday. The referral widget can both be embedded and served as a popup or modal, and the more visible and easy to access your program is, the better results you will see. \n\nPromotion is something that all referral programs need in order to deliver results as you have to create awareness of your referral program to drive participation. In most cases, promoting your referral program to existing customers across a wide range of mediums will help with the visibility of your program and drive engagement.\n \nOn your website or in app; banners, visible referral pages, triggered calls to action, push notifications, and dedicated emails will all increase the visibility of your referral program. Including a footer in your other emails for invoice receipts, reminders, blog articles, and support tickets can also increase awareness of the referral program. A referral program will benefit from promotion across any or all of these channels. \n### Identification\nThis step is where users are enrolled for inclusion in your referral program. With a user registered in your referral program they are able to start making referrals by sharing out their referral link to family and friends.\n\nEnrolling a user in your referral program requires providing Referral SaaSquatch with identifying information about the user such as name, email, and a unique account and user id. The identification step typically happens whenever a user first creates an account on your website or service, makes a purchase, or logs in.\n\nOnce a user has been identified and engages with the referral program the referral process can continue towards Attribution and Conversion. \n### Attribution\nAttribution is the process of building a referral link between two people; the person doing the referring, and the person that was referred. In this step your referral program establishes the connection between these two users. \n\nThe process of attributing this referral of a new user is done automatically through Referral SaaSquatch as part of a correctly configured program. Links and referral codes shared directly, by email, or through social media work across desktop or mobile devices and seamlessly attribute the referral connection between the referrer and the referred user. \n\nOnce the referral connection is made Referral SaaSquatch will send the referrer an email notifying them of the progress of the user they referred. Subsequent steps in the referral process will be accurately applied to both the referrer and referred user with the referral connection correctly attributed.\n### Conversion\nThe conversion step is where the goal-post of your referral program is achieved. This goal-post is the ultimate objective of your referral program. Many organizations have this event as the point at which a referred user pays for a subscription. Other organizations have their goal-post as when a referred user signs up for a free account, or when a referred user makes a purchase of a certain value. This target is flexible and can be tailored to your specific business needs. \n\nIn Referral SaaSquatch, user’s have 3 possible Account Statuses, TRIAL, PAID, and CANCELLED. A TRIAL user, is one that has been identified, but hasn’t reached the goal-post of the program, this is typically when they first create an account with you. When a TRIAL user is converted to PAID, any associated referrals will be converted. This means that if they were referred, rewards will be generated for the person who referred them. It also means that if they were not referred, they are considered a full paying customer and will not be able to be referred later. This status update can be done in several ways, including using our JavaScript library, mobile widgets, or REST API, or manually through your Referral SaaSquatch program’s web portal. \n\nOnce the goal-post has been hit, and the user’s status has been updated, the referral process can progress to fulfillment. \n### Fulfillment\nFulfillment is the process of making sure people are able to use the rewards they earn. Referral SaaSquatch supports manual, semi-automated, and fully-automated reward fulfillment options. Rewards rewards come in many shapes and sizes but are commonly discount percentages, account credits, gift cards, or points. \n\nReferral SaaSuatch supports integrations with a range of payment providers and reward systems to fulfill rewards. Integrations with payment providers allow for seamless inclusion of the rewards with your existing billing platform. Highly customized referral reward solutions are also possible through our API-based referral programs. \n\nThe easiest way to learn more about the topic of fulfillment is to start by exploring our getting started [guides](/guides/). These guides provide step-by-step instructions for how to implement some of the most popular types of referral program rewards."

More information about ways to engage with your existing user and how to drive participation in your referral program can be found in our [Touchpoints article](/success/touchpoints/) in the Success Centre.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3zt4XxP1KgsUaaYWCym6As/3f21d4d0f417b16231c645c0b4e901c4/referral_widget.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n  ![referral widget](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3zt4XxP1KgsUaaYWCym6As/3f21d4d0f417b16231c645c0b4e901c4/referral_widget.png)\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThere are five main methods users have access to for sharing a referral with their friends and family; referral code, referral link, Facebook, Twitter, and email. This guide covers how each of these sharing methods works with Referral SaaSquatch, examples, and the benefits of each platform.\n### Code\nWhen a user is registered in our system they are provided a unique referral code. This code typically comes in the form of FIRSTNAMELASTNAME, such as JOHNDOE. By default the referral code is shown in the referral widget right underneath the main text.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/tw5Z7FRkPeCwM2S4Gg0wS/56600567173286e8581f068191142f21/referral_widget_code.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![referral widget code](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/tw5Z7FRkPeCwM2S4Gg0wS/56600567173286e8581f068191142f21/referral_widget_code.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nThe referral code provides a simple method for users to connect with your referral program. They are a relatively short human-readable code which users can share with their friends and family. Many people are familiar with the concept of a coupon code so using the referral codes as part of your referral program can make the process easier to understand.\n\nThe main limitation of this share option is that it does not take advantage of our automatic referral attribution. The referred user is required to manually input the referral code on your referral landing page. This mean that referred users could forget the code, or have take the extra step of  copying and pasting it. Referral codes can be hidden for products that do not have a coupon or code input field. \n\n### Links\nWhen a user is registered in your referral program they are also provided a unique link to share with their friends and family. Sharing this referral link provides your customers an easy way to connect their friends with your platform by directing them to a referral landing page of your choice. \n\nThe referral links can be found in the user’s widget where they can copy it for sharing with family and friends. The main advantage of referral links is that the referral can be attributed automatically by our squatch.js tracking script. The referral link includes all the information needed to track the referral so there is no need for the referred user to worry about inputting a referral code.\n\nYou can set the destination for referral links on the Settings page of the Setup section of your Referral SaaSquatch portal. This destination can be changed at any time and will even update any user share links that have already been shared.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/71g9oDl9sIMiQIaoQe4ucO/89d159a3871cc2cdc92598106e1297c0/referral_widget_link.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![referral widget link](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/71g9oDl9sIMiQIaoQe4ucO/89d159a3871cc2cdc92598106e1297c0/referral_widget_link.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nAn example of what one of these links look like is: ssqt.co/barYS\n\nBy default Referral SaaSquatch generates these unique links using the ssqt.co short domain. Information on how to use your own domain rather than the default ssqt.co domain can be found in our [documentation](/customshortdomainguide/).\n### Share Messages\nShare messages provide your customers an opportunity to share their referral experience with their friends and family using a number of platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Email.\nIn each user’s personalized referral widget and notification emails there are sharing options for each of the three supported platforms.\nEach of these options includes a platform specific, unique share link which can be used to track share traffic by platform.\n#### Facebook and Twitter\nFacebook and Twitter sharing options allow a referral user to make a post to their social media profile. The share messages themselves are extensively customizable, with settings for editing default share message content in your program portal. This lets you provide your users with a pre-formatted starting point for their shares. \n\nFriction is minimal as we do not require users to authorize access to their account to make the post.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4Oed6VvJ9egQcaGESi6o88/262315336d01d54968fb3f7964da0599/facebook_share_messaging_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![facebook share messaging options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4Oed6VvJ9egQcaGESi6o88/262315336d01d54968fb3f7964da0599/facebook_share_messaging_options.png) <div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div> <a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4oRHdLbUakEoQuOkgMy06O/3fcae2a2f6d6c873e89818ca7a3c23a7/twitter_share_messaging_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">![twitter share messaging options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/4oRHdLbUakEoQuOkgMy06O/3fcae2a2f6d6c873e89818ca7a3c23a7/twitter_share_messaging_options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nConfigurable options for Facebook share messages include the message subject, body, and image.

The email share link in the widget is a standard \"mailto:\" link which lets users complete the share process through their email client of choice. In their email client the referrer can then simply input the email address of the desired recipient and make any personalizations to your referral program's standard email message.\n\nThis default messaging can be customized just like that of the Facebook and Twitter share options. Configurable options for the email share messages include the message subject and body text.\n\n<div>\n<a class=\"docs-lightbox\" href=\"//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3IpX4cwrxugcayCYemCO0O/8c1ebe5e0d3c48c01e242b70c605d947/email_share_message_options.png\" data-lightbox=\"example-set\">\n![email share message options](//images.contentful.com/s68ib1kj8k5n/3IpX4cwrxugcayCYemCO0O/8c1ebe5e0d3c48c01e242b70c605d947/email_share_message_options.png)\n<div><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</div>\n</a>\n</div>\n\nWhile formatting is limited to plain text, allowing users to send the email through their own email account provides a more personalized experience for both the referrer and referred user, and will consistently arrive in the recipient's general inbox, not the promotions folder.\n\nMore information about ways to engage with your existing user and how to drive participation in your referral program can be found in our Referral Program [Touchpoints](/success/touchpoints/) article.\n\nTo learn more about referral programs and how to get your program up and running, check out our [Referral Program 101](/success/intro/) article.\n\n"

It is one of the 5 core terms you should know for your referral program. When you run a referral program you often want to separate the linking of referrals from the process of giving people rewards. For example you want to *attribute* a referral as soon as some one signs in to your website,  but you only want to give a referral reward when the referred person [converts](/topics/conversion) and pays their first bill."

                "en-US": "<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-default\">\n  <h4>Definition</h4>\n  Attribution is the process of tracking a referral link between two people.\n</div>\n\n\n### Share Links\n\nOne of the most popular ways to let people share with their friends is using share links like `http://ssqt.co/hR6O`. Share links are unique links generated for each user that can be used for making referrals.\nShare links rely on [Tracking Cookies](/topics/tracking-cookies) to track when someone has been referred, redirecting referred friends to a website or landing page to get started as a new customers. Share links are\noften used along with [Squatch.js Javascript Library](/squatchjs) or deeplinking like Branch Metrics integration to track when someone has made a successful referral.\n\n**Benefits of Share Links**:\n\n - Work across email, facebook, twitter and other social channels\n - Easy to set up\n - Can have a white-labeled domain\n\n**Disadvantages of Share Links**:\n \n - Relies on Cookies or Deeplinking\n   - Can be blocked by some browsers or cleared regularly\n   - Requires a Deeplinking tool like Branch to work well in Mobile apps\n - Does not support real world face-to-face referrals\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">![Example share link](/assets/images/attribution/sharelink-attribution.png)</div>\n\n\n\n### Referral Codes\n\nReferral codes are a more modern way of sharing that rely on a human-readable code like `BOBTESTERSON`. Referral codes are unique codes that people can use when they sign up for a product\nor check out at a store. Since there is a unique referral code for everyone who shares, referral codes can be used as the sole way of doing attribution. \n\n__Benefits of Referral Codes__:\n\n - Can be used with on-the-phone and in-person sign up processes link Banks, Call Centers and Retail Stores\n - Works well with printed materials\n - Supports mobile-first referrals for native mobile apps\n\n__Disadvantages of Referral Codes__:\n \n - Some companies have policies against allowing any sort of promo codes\n - Can be listed on coupon sites\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">![Example share link](/assets/images/attribution/referralcode-attribution.png)</div>\n\n\n### Hybrid (recommended)\n\nIt is possible to get the best of both worlds by using both human-readable codes and share links. This is the recommended approach for attribution because it provides all of the benefits\nof both of the methods of share links and codes. In most cases, if it's possible to refer friends using a referral code, then it is preferable to go for a hybrid approach and take\nadvantage of the additional analytics provided by links.\n\n__Benefits of Share Links__:\n\n - All of the benefits listed above\n - Best in class success rates\n\n__Disadvantages of Share Links__:\n \n - Some companies have policies against allowing any sort of promo codes\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">![Example share link](/assets/images/attribution/hybrid-attribution.png)</div>\n\n\n### Choosing an attribution method\n\nReferral SaaSquatch has flexible attribution methods for controlling how referrals can be made and tracked. Each attribution method has certain strengths and limitations. Unique share links, for example, are a simple way to power your referral program but they don't work well offline, with cookie blockers or on mobile. Referral codes work well on mobile, but aren't as \nconvenient for online sharing.\n\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tr>\n    <td></td>\n    <td>Desktop</td>\n    <td>Mobile</td>\n    <td>Offline</td>\n<tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>Share Links</th>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\" style=\"color: #CCC\"></i></td>\n    <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>Referral Codes</th>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\" style=\"color: #CCC\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>Hybrid (Recommended)</th>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n    <td><i class=\"fa fa-check-circle fa-3x\"></i></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-default\">\n  Attribution can use share links, referral codes or both (hybrid)\n</div>\n\n\n### Tech Guide\n\nFor details on implementing attribution, see our [developer center guide on attribution](/developer/attribution)"
