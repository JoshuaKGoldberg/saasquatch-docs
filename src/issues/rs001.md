highlights: We've detected that your using a legacy call that's been deprecated. At one point it was possible to use only `account_id` but now `payment_provider_id` is a required field. If your users don't have a `payment_provider_id`, then still include the field, just set it to `null`.

### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure you're including `payment_provider_id: null`.

### Why is This Happening?

If you've been using Referral SaaSquacth for a long time this error is probably happening because `payment_provider_id` hasn't been included in all of your [squatch.js init](/squatchjs/#init) calls or links to the [mobile web view](/mobile/widget/reference/). At one point it was possible to use only `account_id` but now `payment_provider_id` is a required field. 

If you just recently started using Referral SaaSquatch, then it's most likely that `payment_provider_id` has simply been omitted from your [squatch.js init](/squatchjs/#init) call. The `payment_provider_id` is a required field for all squatch.js calls. Please refer to our [squatch.js init](/squatchjs/#init) reference for further details on what are required parameters.
