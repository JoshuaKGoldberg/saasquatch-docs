### How does theming work?

Behind the scenes Referral SaaSquatch theming engine is powered by CSS and HTML templates. We take advantage of a lot of great built-in features to provide
pixel-perfect cross-device rendering.

### What is supported?

We want your referral program to match your brand because we know that it will bring you better results. Our default theming lets the colors of our vanilla widget 
be changed to match your colors.


### Can I removed the "Powered by Referral SaaSquatch"?

White-labelling is only available to our Enterprise customers. Please contact our sales team at <a href="mailto:sales@saasquat.ch?Subject=Theming">sales@saasquat.ch</a> if you are looking at upgrading your plan.

### What are some examples of custom themes?

<a href="http://www.geckoboard.com/">Geckoboard</a>, <a href="http://www.getballpark.com/">Ballpark</a> and the 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shoeboxed.android.phonegapapp&hl=en">Shoeboxed Mobile App</a> are three examples of customers using custom themes.

### How much does a custom theme cost?

Small font and color changes are free. Custom implementation projects will require a chat with our sales team at <a href="mailto:sales@saasquat.ch?Subject=Theming">sales@saasquat.ch</a>
and then we can discuss the scope and budget required to get you up and running smoothly.

### Why can't I change the theme myself?

We manually verify every theming request to ensure forward-compatibility. In our previous experience, when we opened up do-it-yourself CSS and HTML we found that it was
impossible to roll out improvements to our user interface. By having engineers handle theming requests, we can continue to improve your referral program results by
iterating and improving on the user interface and user experience.
