title: Fulfillment
highlights: |
     Fulfillment is the process of making sure people can use the rewards they earn. People can earn rewards from referring their friends, and in some
     cases can get a reward just from being referred. Rewards can be discounts, credit, gift cards, points and many other things. To make sure these rewards
     are more than just a record in the Referral SaaSquatch database, there needs to be some way to fulfill them. Sometimes this just means rewards
     have a coupon code that can be used in other systems, sometimes SaaSquatch keeps track of a balance that is deducted by another system, and other times it
     means there's an automated synchronization process to apply discounts in payment systems. Referral SaaSquatch supports manual, automated
     and semi-automated fulfillment options and even has turnkey connectors that handle fulfillment automatically for you.
