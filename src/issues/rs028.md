### Tips To Fix This

 - Try setting up your payment provider under the install tab in the portal.
 - Find your payment provider in the [installation guide](http://docs.referralsaasquatch.com/guides/) and follow the instructions for configuration. 

### Why is This Happening?

Payment provider-integrated programs (i.e. Stripe, Recurly) require access to the payment provider during user identification to initialize components like coupon codes. 
These components are required for a successful referral program and if we cannot access the payment provider they will not be generated.
