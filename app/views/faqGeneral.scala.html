            </div>
            
            <h3>What is Referral SaaSquatch?</h3>
            <p>Referral SaaSquatch is the easiest way to offer a customer referral program for users of your web app.</p>
            
            <p>With Referral SaaSquatch, you can create the customer referral program you want in your web app, and we handle everything from tracking who has referred who, to integration with your payment provider, to fraud detection and protection to a complete analytics dashboard. You can get started immediately.</p>
            
            <h3>Who is Referral SaaSquatch for?</h3>
            <p>Referral SaaSquatch is for web apps that offer a monthly, recurring service and would like to reward their existing customers for referring new customers.</p>            
            
            <h3>What doesn't Referral SaaSquatch do?</h3>
            <p>Referral SaaSquatch is not an affiliate or partner program. If you are looking to pay third parties a cash commission when they sell your product then Referral SaaSquatch is not for you.</p>
            
            <h3>Why is Referral SaaSquatch better than the other options I'm considering?</h3>
            <p>We're glad you asked us!</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No-risk pricing</strong>. We only charge when you succeed. There is no risk to trying out the program. Other platforms charge expensive monthly fees and setup fees just to get started. </li>
                <li><strong>A great user experience</strong>. Referral SaaSquatch integrates right into your app for a seamless customer experience. Other platforms make your customers go to some other website, sign up for an account, and remember yet another username and password just to be able to invite their friends.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast integration</strong>. We work with the technology you use right out of the box. Others platforms provide you with an API and leave you to do 80% of the work.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus</strong>. Our service is built just for SaaS web apps by a SaaS web app. We know your problems. We live your problems. Other platforms try to solve everyone's problems at the same time, and end up not solving any of them very well.</li> 
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How does Referral SaaSquatch know that a referral has been made?</h3>
            <p>Referral SaaSquatch uses integration with your subscription management system, link tracking, cookie tracking and JavaScript widgets to track from first interaction right to payment. Since we get notified when actual dollars are transfered, you'll only end up giving discounts for real quantifiable new revenue.</p>
            
            <h3>Do my customers have to signup with Referral SaaSquatch before they can make a referral?</h3>
            <p><strong>No, your customers don't need a Referral SaaSquatch account</strong>. By installing Referral SaaSquatch in your app all of your customers will automatically be enrolled. We do this to make inviting friends as fast and seamless as possible, to both increase participation in the program and to protect your brand.</p>
            
            <h3>Can customers complete a referral over the phone?</h3>
            <p>Yes. You will simply add the coupon code they were given to their account manual through your subscription provider. Once that user then logs into your system the referral will be completed.</p>

            <h3>Will Referral SaaSquatch scale? Am I too big for Referral SaaSquatch?</h3>
