<p>
    The Referral SaaSquatch API is organized around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>. Our API is designed to 
    have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication 
    and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> will be returned in all responses from the 
    API, including errors.
</p>

<p>
    To make the Referral SaaSquatch API as explorable as possible, accounts have test-mode API keys as well as live-mode API keys. These keys are both active at the 
    same time. Data created with test-mode credentials will use your payment system's respective test mode and is free to use.
