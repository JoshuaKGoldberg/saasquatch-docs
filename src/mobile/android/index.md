Our Android SDK gives you complete control of the look and feel of your referral program on mobile devices. Our mobile widget is the fastest and simplest way to integrate a referral program into your app, but it doesn't give you as much control as our SDK. Currently our SDK cannot be used with payment system connectors such as Braintree, Stripe, Recurly, or Zuora.

Using the SDK, you can give your users just as good of an experience as you can on the desktop using our API. You can also use as much or as little of the SDK as you like. If you just want to create users in our system and connect them with their referrers, you can do that. If you want to show users what reward they will get if they sign up and offer a full history of referrals they've made and what state each referral is in, you can do that too.

With our SDK you can register your users with Referral SaaSquatch, track your userâ€™s referrals, and fetch information about your users, referral codes and rewards.

Our SDK can also be used with our [Branch integration](../branch-metrics) to provide an exceptional first user experience with a personalized landing page.

See the [quickstart guide](quickstart) for installation instructions. We also have a <a href="https://github.com/saasquatch/mobile-sdk-android-sample" title="Sample App">Sample App <i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> to help you get started.
