<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Custom themes are only available on <b>Pro</b> and <b>Enterprise</b> plans</li>
    <li>A custom theme is just a <b>Git repository</b></li>
    <li>To get started email <a href="mailto:support@saasquat.ch">support@saasquat.ch</a> or your account manager</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customizing your theme</h3>

<p>Every theme is a git repository containing templates and assets. Changes to themes simply
involve changing those files, and pushing those changes into your test or live tenant</p>

<p>To start checkout your git repository and start making changes to the files in that repo. 
Reads the docs on using <a href="/themes/assets">assets</a> to upload CSS, Images and Javascript and read
the handlebars guide on creatings <code>.hbs</code> files.
</p>

<pre>git clone http://gitorigin.com/repo</pre>

<p>
    Once you've made changes that you'd like to preview in your test account, start by pushing those changes
    to the configured git remote.
</p>

<pre>git commit
git push origin</pre>

<p>
    After changes have been pushed to the git repo, they can be pulled into 
    your test tenant or live tenant using the theme publish tool. The ideal workflow would be:
    <br><br>
    1) Publish your theme to your test tenant<br>
    2) Preview in your development environment<br>
    3) Publish your theme to your live tenant<br>
