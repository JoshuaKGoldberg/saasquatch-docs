### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that your tenant has [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) set correctly.
 - Check that you are including a `JWT` if Signed Requests are turned on.
 - Check that you are including a `JWT` if you are not including a paymentProviderId when on a program using one of our direct Payment Provider integrations (e.g. Stripe, Recurly)

### Why is This Happening?

This error is most commonly due to making a call to Referral SaaSquatch without a JWT when [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) are turned on.

If you are encountering this error during testing, please make sure that you are loading the widget in a new browser session (cleared cache or new clear incognito session)

Check out our [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) page to find out more about when these types of requests are required, how to turn them on/off, and how to generate a `checksum` or `JWT`.
