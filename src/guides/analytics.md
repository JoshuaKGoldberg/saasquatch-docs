### Definitions 
The new Analytics feature a ton of data. These definitions should help explain what each number represents. 

* **Unique Visitors**: The total number of users that have seen the referral program via any channel (Web, Mobile, Email) so as they have seen some form of a referral widget.

* **Active Referrers**: The total number of users that have click a share or copy button via any channel (Web, Mobile, Email) so as it could be safely assumed that a referral was started while understanding that we do not track if a referral was actually published via any medium.  

* **Successful Referrers**: The number of users who have referred at least one other user and set their account to the PAID status. 

* **Referred Visitors**: The number of unique users, as determined by ip address, that clicked a referral link during the time period in question. 

* **Referred users**: The number of unique users that signed up as a result of being referred based on user id. 

* **Referred Conversions**: The number of unique users that have their account set to the PAID status as a result of being referred.

#### Medium:

* **Engagement Medium**: The version of the referral program widget / end user experience that a user interacted with to include mobile, popup, embedded and email.  

* **New vs Returning**: The number of first time visitors (visitors that were inserted/saved in that time period)during the time period vs. the number of non first time visitors during the time period.  

* **Time**: The day and hour in which the events in question occurred. 

* **Share Medium**: The network or channel that a referral was made on to include things like facebook, twitter, email and direct (copy link). 

* **Registered Participants**: The number of users registered with the referral program (i.e. via widget push, API, or bulk upload) during the time period.

### Tracking on older programs
The new Analytics feature uses new techniques to gather more data and insights from your Referral Program. If your program launched before the new Analytics were launched (July 13th 2016) the new insights and data will only be available from this point onwards. 

### Tracking with Pending Referrals
When using the SaaSquatch Security feature with any type of moderation that is not auto-moderation, the referrals that are kept in the pending bucket will not be counted towards the successful referrals.

In addition when either approving or denying referrals, please keep in mind that for the tracking of successful referrals only the first state counted. So when a referral is first denied but later approved, this referral will not be counted as “successful”. 

If you have any questions in regards to using the Security feature in combination with the new analytics, please don’t hesitate to reach out to your Customer Success team or shoot our friendly support staff an email.
