### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you're using the right API key (test or live) to match the `tenant_alias` that you're using
 - Check that you're not including extra paramaters like `mode` or `fbShareImage` in your checksum generation
 - Find sample code in the article about [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests)

### Why is This Happening?

You're probably getting this error because your checksum generation code isn't outputting the correct string to be signed.
Most often this is caused because people forget to sort their parameters before signing them or because they're using extra parameters.
Check out the [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) for a full walkthrough with code samples.
