slug: how-it-works
highlights: The magic behind Referral SaaSquatch is that we track referrals and automatically give rewards using subscription system integrations with common platforms such as Stripe, Recurly, Braintree, and Zuora. We also give you a simple JavaScript library to include your referral program inside your web app.
