### Tips To Fix This

 - Log in to your Stripe dashboard and make sure the `payment_provider_id` is a real Customer ID
 - Try setting `payment_provider_id: null` if your users don't exist in Stripe

### Why is This Happening?

We immediately validate any `payment_provider_id` by using it to look up a Stripe Customer with a matching Customer ID. If you're running into
this issue it means that we couldn't find a Stripe Customer using the `payment_provider_id` that you provided. If some of your free users don't exist in Stripe, then you can 
set `payment_provider_id: null` for those users.
