### Tips To Fix This

 - Check that you're using the right API key (test or live) to match the `tenant_alias` that you're using
 - Check that you're not including extra paramaters like `mode` or `fbShareImage` in your checksum generation
 - Find sample code in the article about [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests#how-build-jwt)

### Why is This Happening?

You're probably getting this error because your JWT generation code isn't formatting the JWT correctly.
Most often this is caused by failure to match our field names and format exactly when building your JWT.
