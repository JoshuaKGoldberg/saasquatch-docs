### Tips To Fix This

 - Read the article about [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests)
 - Make sure to include a `checksum`

### Why is This Happening?

Once you've used [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests) at least once by including a `checksum` then you'll need to use a `checksum` every time afterwards. If you've used a `checksum` for Squatch.js then you'll need to use that for the mobile webview, and vice versa.

If you're encountering this error mid-development while launching your program, then we can temporarily disable signed requests for you to help you better understand how to generate and use a `checksum`. After launch, a `checksum` should always be calculated and included.

Signed Request are important because when you're using third party javascript like Squatch.js it's possible for your customers to arbitrarily change the data that you've passed into Squatch.js. For example, a clever user could potentially abuse
your system by setting `account_status: "PAID"`. To prevent this, we require a `checksum` as a security measure whenever a `payment_provider_id` doesn't exist.

We recommend that all our customers use a `checksum` to enable [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests). It's a good thing to use.
