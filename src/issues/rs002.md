### Tips To Fix This

 - Read the article about [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests)
 - Make sure to include a `checksum`

### Why is This Happening?

When you're using third party javascript like Squatch.js it's possible for your customers to arbitrarily change the data that you've passed into Squatch.js. For example, a clever user could potentially abuse
your system by setting `account_status: "PAID"`. To prevent this, we require a `checksum` as a security measure whenever a `payment_provider_id` doesn't exist.

We recommend that all our customers use a `checksum` to enable [Signed Requests](/squatchjs/signed-requests). It's a good thing to use.
