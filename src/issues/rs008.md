### Tips To Fix This

 - Log in to your Recurly dashboard and make sure the `payment_provider_id` is a real Account ID
 - Try setting `payment_provider_id: null` if your users don't exist in Recurly

### Why is This Happening?

We immediately validate any `payment_provider_id` by using it to [look up a Recurly Account with a matching Account Code](https://docs.recurly.com/api/accounts#get-account). If you're running into
this issue, it means that we couldn't find a Recurly account using the `payment_provider_id` that you provided. If some of your free users don't exist in Recurly, then you can 
set `payment_provider_id: null` for those users.
