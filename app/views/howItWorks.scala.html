        <p>The magic behind Referral SaaSquatch is that we track referrals and automatically give rewards using subscription system integrations with common platforms such as <a href="/stripe">Stripe</a>, <a href="/recurly">Recurly</a>, <a href="/braintree">Braintree</a>, and <a href="/zuora">Zuora</a>.
        We also give you a simple JavaScript library to include your referral program inside your web app.</p>

                    The JavaScript library is how you can show your referral program inside your web app.
