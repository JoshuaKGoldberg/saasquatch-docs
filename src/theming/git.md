### What is git?

**Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents at the same time**, and 
without stepping on each other's toes. At Referral SaaSquatch we use git as the basis for tracking and versioning custom themes. We do this because referral programs
are usually a collaboration between a lot of people, such as:

 - **Creative directors** want to maintain brand guidelines
 - **Front-end developers** that want pixel perfect hex-code exact matching with their other assets
 - **Copy writers** that want to update each individual piece of text, share message and notification
 - **Referral SaaSquatch product developers** that want to introduce new ways of sharing and update your code
 
Git lets all of these people work in parallel on the referral program user experience without every losing anyone's changes. It also maintains a history so that 
we can test new wording, layouts and changes, and roll back those changes if they don't produce the desired results.

### How do I find out more about git?

If you're a **software developer**, you probably want to just check [this interative tutorial](https://try.github.io) on using git.

If you're **not comfortable using the command line right now**, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions without using the command line, 
including: Creating a repository, Forking a repository and Being social. We recommend the github [getting started with git guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).


### Got it. I already know Git. What's next?

Every Referral SaaSquatch custom theme is a git repo. If you're getting started on a **Pro** or **Enterprise** account, then 
you should [contact your account manager](mailto:support@saasquat.ch) to get set up with a basic custom theme. Then you
can clone that theme to start modifying the [templates](/themes/templates) and uploading new [assets](/themes/assets).
