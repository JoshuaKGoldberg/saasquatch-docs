### Tips To Fix This

 - Please try again. This is most likely a temporary communication issue between SaaSquatch's servers and the servers of the company that hosts your payment system.
 - If the problem persists, then please contact us and include the details being used for this user (e.g. tenant_alias, user_id, account_id)

### Why is This Happening?

This error can happen when the company that hosts your payment system (e.g. Stripe, Recurly, Braintree or Zuora) is having a temporary connection issue with their servers or data center. Most often these connectivity issues are temporary and service is restored quickly.

In some cases this problem might be due to some invalidated account credentials, a longer term outage of the payment system or some other sort of unexpected case while communicating with your payment system.

These types of errors should not continue to persist, so if you keep seeing this error, please get in touch.
