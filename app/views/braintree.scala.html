        <ul class="unstyled">
            <li>
                <b>Test mode vs. live mode</b> - We let you test your referral program using Braintree Sandbox and fake credit cards before deploying to your production environment. To set up sandbox, follow this guide using your Braintree Sandbox account.

        <h3><span class="label label-success">Step 1</span> Configure Braintree</h3>
        <p>Before installation Referral SaaSquatch there are a few things that need to be configured using <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a> because they can't be set up using the API.</p>

        <h4>Set up a Braintree Custom Field and Discount</h4>
        
        <p>
        We use Braintree's Custom Fields to track when someone uses a referral code and Braintree's Discounts to apply referral discounts. These fields need to be set up in Braintree before turning on the referral program.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Login to Braintree</a> and go to Settings -> Processing. 
                Add a custom field with the API name <b>saasquatch_coupon</b> with the "store and pass through" option set.</li>
            <li>Go to Recurring Billing -> Add-ons / Discounts on the left-hand menu and add a discount with the id <b>saasquatch_discount</b>, 
                name "Saasquatch Discount", and amount (1.00 ~ though this value isn't really used, it's just a placeholder because the field can't be left 0 or empty).
                Leave the duration as "For Duration of Subscription".</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="muted">
            <b>Note:</b> It is not required to setup a test environment but it will make testing easier for you.
        </p>

        <hr/>
        <h4>Add your Braintree API Keys in the SaaSquatch Portal</h4>
        
        <p>
        We connect to the Braintree API using your Braintree API keys. This lets us automatically apply discounts to people’s accounts.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Login to Braintree</a> and go to Account -> My User then scoll down and open "API Keys" under Authorization. <b>Copy the “Merchant ID”, "Public Key" and "Private Key"</b>.</li>
            <li><a href="http://app.referralsaasquatch.com">Login to Referral SaaSquatch</a> and go to “Install” and click “Authorize”. <b>Paste in the “Merchant ID”, "Public Key" and "Private Key" that you just copied</b>, and press connect.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <hr/>
        <h4>Add SaaSquatch to your Braintree webhooks</h4>

        <p>
        We use Braintree webhooks to determine when referral discounts should be made, updated, or ended.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><a href="http://app.referralsaasquatch.com">Login to Referral SaaSquatch</a> and go to “Install” and copy the "Webhook URL”.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Login to Braintree</a> and go to Settings -> Webhooks. 
                Click "Create a webhook" if you have no existing webhooks or "New Webhook" otherwise. Paste the 
                SaaSquatch "Webhook URL", check the box for all available Subscription notifications, and click "Create Webhook".</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Repeat this process for both your <b>test</b> and <b>live</b> accounts. <b>Tired of all the clicking?</b> Help us reduce the work here by encouraging Braintree to add Oauth and RestHook support.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="label label-success">Step 2</span> Connect referrals with the SaaSquatch API</h3>
        
        <p>
        On your payment page you'll need to add an extra input element that accepts a <span class="docs-monospace">referral_code</span> and pass it to us via the <a href="/api">REST API</a> after the payment information has been successfully added to your customer in Braintree.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add a <span class="docs-monospace">referral_code</span> field to your payment form. You can show it to your users so that they can type in their friend's codes, or it can just be a hidden input field on the page.
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;input type="hidden" name="referral_code" /&gt;</pre>
            </li>
            <li>Use <a href="/squatchjs#autofill">Squatch.js Autofill</a> to read the referral cookie and set the value in the form input you just created.
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">_sqh.push(["autofill", "name=referral_code"]);</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                On your server, lookup the coupon information to include in your Braintree Subscription call using the SaaSquatch REST API.
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-curl">GET https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{TENANT_ALIAS}/coupon/{REFERRAL_CODE}</pre>
                <span class="muted">This step is important because it ensures that new customers will receive their 
                discount immediately. If this step is left out then the referral discount will be applied as a refund to the first transaction 
                at a later time. Referrers get credit on their next bill.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                On your server, after the Braintree customer has been created, pass the newly created customer id and referral code to the SaaSquatch REST API.
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-curl">POST https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{TENANT_ALIAS}/coupon</pre>
                <span class="muted">This step ensures that we can apply referral credit to a new user right away.</span>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <strong>For Proration</strong> - If you're using subscriptions with automatic proration and you change the subscription price, you will need to recalculate the discount during upgrades and downgrades.
            You need to apply the result to the subscription before the prorated charges go through. If this step is left out then the prorated charge will have the existing 
            discount subtracted from it and the new discount amount will be applied to the upcoming bill.
            
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-curl">GET https://app.referralsaasquatch.com/api/v1/{TENANT_ALIAS}/account/{ACCOUNT_ID}</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For Transparent Redirects</strong> When you're setting up your payment forms use <span class="docs-monospace">customer[custom_fields][saasquatch_coupon]</span> instead 
            of <span class="docs-monospace">referral_code</span> in your forms and read 
            this <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/customers/tr_fields#custom_fields">Braintree article about custom fields</a>.
