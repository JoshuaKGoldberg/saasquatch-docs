highlights: We've detected that your using a legacy call that's been deprecated. At one point it was possible to use only `account_id` but now `payment_provider_id` is a required field. If your users don't have a `payment_provider_id`, then still include the field, just set it to null.

### Tips To Fix This

 - Make sure you're using a valid `payment_provider_id`

### Why is This Happening?

You're probably only going to run into this issue if you've been using Referral SaaSquacth for a long time and you are one of our first users.

If you just recently started using Referral SaaSquatch, then you've probably worked yourself into a strange state and should get in touch with us to see how you got here.

If you're one of our existing customers, then you might be mid migration between the old world when `account_id` was the only required variable to the new world where `payment_provider_id` is now always required. 
This error is probably happening because `payment_provider_id` hasn't been included in all of your squatch.js init calls or links to the mobile web view.
