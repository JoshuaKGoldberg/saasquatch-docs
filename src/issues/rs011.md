### Tips To Fix This

 - Log in to your Zuora dashboard and make sure the `payment_provider_id` is a real Account ID
 - Try setting `payment_provider_id: null` if your users don't exist in Zuora

### Why is This Happening?

We immediately validate any `payment_provider_id` by using it to look up a Zuora Account with a matching AccountId. 
Note that in Zuora an `AccountId` is different than an `AccountNumber` ((docs)[https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/D_SOAP_API/C_SOAP_API_Reference/F_API_Objects/Account]). If you're running into
this issue it means that we couldn't find a Zuora Account using the `payment_provider_id` that you provided. If some of your free users don't exist in Zuora, then you can 
set `payment_provider_id: null` for those users.
