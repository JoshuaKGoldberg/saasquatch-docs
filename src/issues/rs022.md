### Tips To Fix This

 - Use a valid value for `account_status` (one of `PAID`, `TRAIL`, `FREE` or `CANCELLED`)
 - `account_status` is optional and can be left out

### Why is This Happening?

There are only a few values for `account_status` that are valid: `PAID`, `TRAIL`, `FREE` or `CANCELLED`. Make sure that you
don't have a type-o and that you're using one of these values in your code.

Also it's important to remember that `account_status` is an optional field and can be left out.
If you don't set a value it will keep whatever value was last set.
If you have never set a value then it will default to `TRIAL`.
