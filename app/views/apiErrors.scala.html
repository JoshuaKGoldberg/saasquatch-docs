            Referral SaaSquatch uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate 
            success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, a 
            coupon code doesn't exist, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Referral SaaSquatch's servers.
