The **portal share message editor** allows you to write the default messages that will be used by your customers to refer others to your product. These messages can incorporate Handlebars-style variables to allow for easy customization around the current referral program context, and can include references to [template fields](/themes/fields) and **short tags**. Short tags act as an alias to longer commonly used template fields, and may provide more complicated additional functionality such as conversion of currency unit (*E.g. cents to dollars*). The table that follows presents each of the currently available short tags. 


Short tags and fields can be included in your messaging by placing the name of the variable between symmetric curly brackets (*E.g.* `{{emailsharelink}}` *or* `{{user.firstName}}`) following the [Handlebars convention](http://handlebarsjs.com/). Embedded template fields with corresponding short tag aliases will be **replaced** with their respective short tags when viewed in the portal share message editor.
